\subsection{Objective}

\par Satellite photographs can be translated to map images using the GAN model. Conditional adversarial networks are being studied as a broad solution to image-to-image translation problems.



\subsection{Motivation}
\par GANs are used in the conditional circumstance. In the same way as GANs learn a generative model of data, conditional GANs (cGANs) train a conditional generative model. As a result, convolutional neural networks (cGANs) are well-suited to image-to-image translation tasks, where we condition on an input image and produce a corresponding output image.
GANs have garnered a lot of attention in the previous two years, and many of the solutions we look at in this paper have already been described. Previous research focused on specific applications, thus it's uncertain how useful image-conditional GANs can be as a general-purpose solution for image-to-image translation. Our key contribution is to demonstrate that conditional GANs produce reasonable results for a variety of problems.
